# Project Peritus

Peritus is a local-first, Verus-first coding-agent harness under active foundation work. The
repository is not yet a releasable product.

## Foundation checks

Rust `1.97.1`, Verus `0.2026.08.09.92f466f`, and vstd revision
`92f466f247f45128c630d1c843fd6e27d2115587` are pinned. Install those tools, then use the
checked-in command surface:

```text
just check          # format, build, tests, Clippy, docs, and workspace policy
just licenses       # dependency, source, and license policy
just toolchain      # probe the installed Rust/Verus/vstd/Z3 pins
just verus-verify   # clean workspace verification through cargo-verus
just verus-build    # verified release build
just gate-a         # the complete A0 foundation gate
```

All dependency-resolving commands use `--locked`. `architecture.toml` is the reviewed registry
for crate ownership, dependency layers, verification classes, trusted source roots, and source
size exceptions. New crates must inherit the workspace package metadata and lints, declare their
owner/layer/class in Cargo metadata, and be registered in that policy file.

The checked `cargo xtask` interface also works from a workspace member directory. Root CI rejects
nested or legacy Cargo configuration before that convenience is considered trustworthy, so a
repository that has not passed the root gate must not treat a member-local Cargo alias as evidence.

The [foundation toolchain policy](docs/foundation-toolchain.md) documents the exact pins, accepted
Verus cfg names, locked-input rules, and the known cargo-verus/bundled-Z3 metadata discrepancy.

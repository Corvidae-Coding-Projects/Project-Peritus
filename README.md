# Project Peritus

Peritus is a local-first, Verus-first coding-agent harness under active foundation work. The
repository is not yet a releasable product.

## Foundation checks

Rust `1.97.1`, Verus `0.2026.08.09.92f466f`, and vstd revision
`92f466f247f45128c630d1c843fd6e27d2115587` are pinned. Install those tools, then use the
checked-in command surface:

```text
just check          # format, build, tests, Clippy, docs, and workspace policy
just licenses       # dependency, source, and license policy
just toolchain      # probe the installed Rust/Verus/vstd/Z3 pins
just ordinary-api   # audit formal APIs callable from ordinary safe Rust
just verus-verify   # full TCB-aware verification plus no-cheating V/H roots
just verus-build    # full verified release plus no-cheating V/H builds
just gate-a         # the complete formal-foundation gate
```

All dependency-resolving commands use `--locked`. `architecture.toml` is the reviewed registry
for crate ownership, dependency layers, verification classes, trusted source roots, and source
size exceptions. New crates must inherit the workspace package metadata and lints, declare their
owner/layer/class in Cargo metadata, and be registered in that policy file.

The checked `cargo xtask` interface also works from a workspace member directory. Root CI rejects
nested or legacy Cargo configuration before that convenience is considered trustworthy, so a
repository that has not passed the root gate must not treat a member-local Cargo alias as evidence.

The [foundation toolchain policy](docs/foundation-toolchain.md) documents the exact pins, accepted
Verus cfg names, locked-input rules, and the known cargo-verus/bundled-Z3 metadata discrepancy.
The [formal foundation](docs/formal-foundation.md) documents the verified value types, zero-cheat
TCB baseline, semantic manifests, and the claims that A1 deliberately does and does not establish.
The [test and conformance foundation](docs/test-conformance-foundation.md) defines deterministic
clock, identifier, event, fault, script, provider, tool, repository and content-addressed fixture
semantics, plus the runtime-neutral conformance runner and its fail-closed suite verdicts.
Focused A2 checks are `cargo test --package peritus-test-support --all-targets --all-features
--locked` and `cargo test --package peritus-conformance --all-targets --all-features --locked`.
The [C0 durable-state guide](docs/c0-durable-state.md) documents the journal, projections,
artifacts, migrations, and evidence boundary. The [C1 workspace guide](docs/c1-workspaces.md)
documents structured Git worktrees, typed atomic patches, target-owned authorization, snapshots,
rollback, and restart reconciliation.
The [GitHub governance runbook](docs/github-governance.md) defines the GitHub Team-compatible
repository ruleset and required `Gate A` status that must be active after the A1 genesis push.
Immutable required-workflow authority remains an explicitly documented Enterprise Cloud deferral.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Implement the complete production C6 Context and Memory boundary with separate maintainable
  `peritus-role`, `peritus-context`, and `peritus-memory` orchestration crates (#15)
- Project every canonical B1 actor role into an explicit non-widening context policy, including
  writer, reviewer, fixer, evaluator, and evolver profiles plus restricted service/worker/plugin
  profiles, without introducing another security-role identity or issuing capabilities
- Add checked ordered capability views whose Verus specification proves every visible operation
  remains permitted by the exact B1 actor role, along with presentation, contribution, freshness,
  memory, hidden-reasoning, and producer-ancestry controls
- Require an independent reviewer view to use fresh read-only context, exclude producer-hidden
  reasoning and memory-derived producer rationale, and preserve every B2 reviewer-independence
  requirement as evidence that later orchestration must establish
- Add bounded provenance-aware context nodes that bind content digests, authority and trust
  ceilings, semantic classes, required/optional mode, priority, recency, role visibility, and
  canonical dependencies, with graph rejection for duplicates, missing edges, and cycles
- Add deterministic required-first context selection with complete dependency closures, atomic
  optional admission, stable integer precedence, explicit selection/omission reasons, checked node
  and byte limits, and exact context-window, output-reserve, protocol-overhead, used, and remaining
  token accounting
- Add transactional compaction validation over selected canonical source ranges, including policy
  binding, digest and lineage checks, visibility, range ordering, token savings, protected policy,
  specification, user-instruction, capability, and blocking-finding classes, and trust-preserving
  derivation only when every source and policy allow it
- Add provider-neutral render plans whose individually delimited segments preserve source identity,
  message role, provenance, authority, trust, context class, content digest, and bounded bytes
  without concatenating untrusted text into an elevated instruction channel
- Add immutable scoped memory records with stable identities and revisions, original provenance,
  source events, supporting and contradicting evidence, bounded confidence and relevance features,
  logical observations, review/expiry state, feedback, and canonical content digests
- Add explicit memory review, quarantine, release, expiry, supersession, forgetting, and tombstone
  transitions; tombstones bind prior digest and revision and deterministically dominate replayed
  records at or below the deleted revision
- Add deterministic filter-before-rank retrieval with exact project/workspace/repository/actor/role
  scope checks, lifecycle and tombstone exclusion, confidence and feature policy, bounded integer
  score components, stable identity tie-breaking, result/token limits, and an explanation for every
  selected or excluded record
- Add rebuildable canonical memory indexes and digests over active records and tombstones, with
  deterministic posting lists and equivalence tests that keep storage an implementation detail for
  the future C0/D0 composition boundary
- Add context and memory poisoning matrices proving instruction-like repository, external, tool,
  provider, and recalled text remains quoted non-authoritative evidence with its original
  provenance and cannot become policy, a capability, or an authority transition
- Add focused no-cheating Verus roots for role narrowing, context graph/selection/accounting and
  compaction invariants, memory non-authority, lifecycle advancement, tombstone dominance, and
  bounded retrieval; register all three crates in architecture, ordinary-API, reproducibility, and
  hosted formal-governance command surfaces
- Add the complete C6 design, operating guide, crate READMEs, construction/selection/compaction/
  rendering/lifecycle/index/retrieval test matrices, and the documented D0 integration boundary

- Implement the complete production C5 Model Providers boundary with six maintainable model-layer
  crates for the provider-neutral protocol, shared provider core, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and
  explicitly configured compatible endpoints (#14)
- Add protocol v1 checked identities, messages and bounded multimodal content, JSON Schema tools
  and results, strict structured output, reasoning summaries and opaque replay state, persistence
  and continuation controls, deterministic canonical request identity, complete capability/profile
  negotiation, and immutable accepted/rejected compatibility fixtures
- Add ordered normalized response streams for text, reasoning, tool arguments, refusals, usage,
  cache, rate limits, response identity, provider extensions, finish reasons, and typed terminal
  failures, with exact duplicate handling, fragmented UTF-8/JSON assembly, bounded reduction, and
  fail-closed malformed/incomplete/cancelled outcomes
- Add a hardened provider-core effect boundary with validated redacted endpoints and credentials,
  Reqwest/Rustls ownership, bounded HTTP and byte streams, SSE/NDJSON framing, cancellation-aware
  backoff, conservative retry and ambiguous-submission classification, owned stream teardown, and
  an explicit server-side response cancellation seam, plus bounded subprocess invocation with
  explicit arguments/environment isolation, output/deadline ceilings, cancellation, and child reap
- Add the current first-party OpenAI Responses adapter with multimodal/tool/structured-output and
  reasoning projection, prompt caching, usage/rate metadata, heterogeneous SSE normalization,
  background exact-cursor continuation, and confirmed background response cancellation
- Add the current first-party Anthropic Messages adapter with top-level system projection,
  multimodal content and tools, structured output, adaptive thinking and opaque signature replay,
  prompt caching, required version/beta headers, cumulative usage, and Messages SSE normalization
- Add separately profiled account-backed OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude transports that use the
  providers' already-authenticated official executables as stateless credential-owning routers,
  disable native tools and ambient integration surfaces, normalize schema-constrained text/inert
  tool proposals/usage, never inspect account tokens, and advertise advisory output limits
- Add both documented stable-v1 Google Gemini families: Interactions for new development and
  generateContent/streamGenerateContent for existing integrations, including tools, multimodal
  content, response schemas, thinking signatures, cached content, safety/finish observations,
  retention/state policy, and explicit `x-goog-api-key` authentication without an SDK `v1beta`
  fallback
- Add separately validated compatible Responses and Chat Completions profiles whose explicit
  dialect, paths, authentication, framing, supported fields, mappings, lifecycle, retry guarantees,
  limits, and response-ID semantics default to the minimum safe feature set rather than inferred
  OpenAI parity
- Extend A2 with a nonempty fourteen-case provider suite and owned deterministic loopback servers,
  including bounded multi-exchange scripts on one stable endpoint, covering capability honesty,
  ordering/deduplication, fragmented tools, malformed/incomplete streams, cancellation,
  authentication, rate limiting and retry-after, transient recovery, ambiguous submission, usage,
  redaction, and selected/foreign adapter isolation
- Qualify both account-backed routes with fresh-subject hermetic fake executables covering exact
  invocation isolation, structured output, terminal failure, cancellation, and child reap without
  a provider installation, account credential, or live network; separately qualify shared process
  output-overflow and timeout handling through portable real-process tests
- Add provider-specific immutable request/stream/error fixture corpora with manifests and SHA-256
  inventories, crate READMEs, the C5 operating guide, and hosted Linux/macOS/Windows provider
  qualification wiring
- Add thirteen Verus-verified C5 functional-core obligations and connect ordinary runtime paths to
  checked capability intersection, reducer transition and terminal facts, exact deduplication,
  completed-fragment predicates, monotonic usage, retry legality, and provider non-authority

- Implement complete production C3 Platform Security Backends (#12)
- Implement complete production C2 Process/Sandbox Backplane (#11)
- Implement C1 Git, workspace, and atomic patching (#10)
- Implement C0 journal, projections, artifacts, migrations, and evidence (#9)
- Implement B3 domain protocol and canonical codec (#8)
- Implement B0 lifecycle kernel (#7)
- Implement B2 acceptance specification and quality policy (#6)
- Implement B1 policy, leases, budgets, and approvals (#5)
- Implement A2 test/conformance foundation (#4)

### Fixed
- Canonicalize account-runtime fake executable working directories so their isolation assertions
  remain valid across macOS `/var` and `/private/var` path aliases
- Make explicit fake-HTTP release points wait briefly for an already-issued peer close instead of
  racing the macOS loopback stack with a single immediate observation
- Make malformed completed UTF-8 or JSON establish an irreversible failed reducer terminal, reject
  all post-terminal events without replacing the original outcome, and classify explicit
  non-accepting HTTP responses separately from ambiguous post-send failures
- Preserve bounded first-party provider request IDs on normalized success and failure observations
  while continuing to exclude credentials, response bodies, prompts, outputs, and tool arguments
  from diagnostics and fake-server artifacts
- Exercise retry-after and transient recovery through real two-exchange HTTP servers for every
  direct HTTP adapter instead of substituting an in-memory transport for those conformance paths
- Restore hosted Linux, macOS, and Windows runner portability across native sandbox, process, Git,
  patch, network, durable registry, and tool-shell test boundaries (#12)
- Remove macOS socket-close races from the managed-proxy worker-backpressure conformance test
- Stabilize hosted Windows native shell conformance polling under runner scheduling delays
- Make managed-proxy HTTP fixtures issue each complete request in one socket write, and preserve the
  process cleanup regression's timing distinction with realistic hosted-runner scheduling allowance

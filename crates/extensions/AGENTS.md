# crates/extensions — navigation

## Responsibility

External integration boundary for the MCP bridge. Plugin contracts live in foundation; isolated execution lives in runtime.

## Files in this folder

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [README.md](README.md) | Human overview and linked directory map for this architectural area. |

## Child areas

| Folder | Role / next waypoint |
| --- | --- |
| [peritus-mcp/](peritus-mcp/AGENTS.md) | Bounded MCP JSON-RPC server and non-authoritative Peritus bridge. |

## Working in this area

Read the parent module that declares this directory, then use the file table to follow the narrow implementation path and its callers. Keep contracts, host effects, persistence, and presentation in their owning layers; directory proximity alone does not transfer authority.

Navigation: [Parent waypoint](../AGENTS.md) · [Repository map](../../AGENTS.md).

Keep this waypoint aligned when local files or child responsibilities change. Descriptions are orientation, not a substitute for reading the current implementation.
